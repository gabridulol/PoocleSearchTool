collision
detection
algorithms
are
used
to
detect
when
virtual
objects
collide
and
the
results
of
these
collisions
this
type
of
algorithm
is
used
by
many
research
areas
such
as
simulation
automatic
path
finding
tolerance
checking
among
others
this
type
of

is

intel
created
the
harp
platform
which
uses
a

this
decreased
the

allowing
real

processing
of

applications
such
as

in

we
propose
a
heterogeneous
system
in
order
to
use
the

on
the

as
an

our
