SENDAS: Scalable ENrichment for mobility DAta Sets
Abstract. Recent years of technological advancement and popularization has
grown the availability of mobility data, collected from different sources. Analyzing such data is an active research and industrial development field, with a
diverse range of applications. However, trajectory data has also been following
the Big Data trend, and currently existing tools lack of scalability. To cover this
gap, we introduce Sendas – Scalable ENrichment for mobility DAta Sets –, a
new Scala library built around the Apache Spark framework, enabling parallel
and distributed execution for mobility analysis techniques. We present definitions that extend state-of-the-art notions of trajectory naming, flow calculation
and mobility motif identification, and also conduct comparative performance
evaluation, finding running time improvements of 4 to 6 times when compared
to non-parallel execution.

A Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Component Optimization
Problems: the Case of the Travelling Thief Problem
ABSTRACT
Real-world problems many times are characterized by being composed by multiple interdependent components. In
this case, benchmark problems that do not represent that
interdependency are not a good choice to assess algorithms
performance. Recently in the literature a benchmark problem called Travelling Thief Problem was proposed to better represent real-world multi-component problems. TTP is
a combination of two well-known problems: 0-1 Knapsack
Problem (KP) and the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based optimization
approach called Multi-Component Genetic Algorithm (MCGA)
for solving TTP. The ideia is solve the overall problem instead of each sub-component separately. Starting from solution for the TSP component, obtained by the Chained
Lin-Kernighan heuristic, the MCGA applies the evolutionary process (evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation)
iteratively using different operators for KP and TSP components. The MCGA was tested on some representative
instances of TTP available in the literature. The comparisons show that MCGA obtains competitive solutions for
TTP instances with a number of cities between 51 and 783.

Robust Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm for
Multi-objective Environmental/Economic Dispatch
Problem with Uncertainties
Abstract—The economic load dispatch problem has been
formulated as the minimization of total fuel cost needed to
generate electricity in power plants. Due to the environmental
issues that arise from the emissions of polluting gases produced
by fossil-fueled electric power plants, it becomes the environmental/economic dispatch (EED) multi-objective optimization
problem. EED problems have been most commonly solved using
deterministic models (without considering uncertainties). In this
context, a robust model to cope with uncertainties is necessary,
because the deterministic model is not able to reflect some real
condition in practical applications, since fuel cost and emission
coefficients may be subjected to inaccuracies, for instance. In
this paper, both deterministic and robust EED problem models
are first formulated, and the Robust Evolutionary Optimization
Algorithm - REOA is proposed. For the robust model, the
worst case scenario is estimated, to find reliable solutions that
still feasible and have a good performance under the action of
parametric uncertainties. Comparative studies are carried out to
examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Simulation
results are presented for the standard IEEE 30-bus system. The
obtained results are satisfactory compared to the best solutions
found in the literature.
